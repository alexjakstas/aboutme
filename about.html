                    My name is John and living the simple life and saved my life
                </h2>
                <p class="main_text">
                    <span>I used to be a pack rat.</span>, I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the
                    truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too much.
                </p>
                <p class="main_text"> Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live
                    in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.</p>
                <h3>
                    How i turned thing around
                </h3>
                <p class="main_text">
                    <span>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything.</span> I literally put 90% of
                    my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                    It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to
                    do. And it worked.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Now I live the simple life
                </h3>
                <p class="main_text">
                    Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work
                    more, and I have more free time to enjoy.
                </p>
                <p class="main_text"> With how much it turned my life around,<span> I felt like I had no choice but to
                        start sharing how I did it</span>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well,
                    which is why I started this site! </p>
